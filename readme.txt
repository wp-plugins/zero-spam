Zero Spam makes blocking spam comments a cinch. Install, activate and enjoy a spam-free site.

== Description ==

**Why should your users prove that they're humans by filling out captchas? Let bots prove their not bots with the <a href="http://www.benmarshall.me/wordpress-zero-spam-plugin/" target="_blank">WordPress Zero Spam plugin</a>.**

WordPress Zero Spam blocks registration spam and spam in comments automatically without any additional config or setup. Just install, activate and enjoy a spam-free site.

Zero Spam was initially built based on the work by <a href="http://davidwalsh.name/wordpress-comment-spam" target="_blank">David Walsh</a>.

Major features in WordPress Zero Spam include:

* **No captcha**, because spam is not users' problem
* **No moderation queues**, because spam is not administrators' problem
* **Blocks spam comments** with the use of JavaScript
* **Blocks spam registrations** with the use of JavaScript

**Languages:** English
